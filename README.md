🛡️ Sovereign Node API — from The Fort That Holds

Your infrastructure. Your terms. No lock-in. No gods. Just keys.

Sovereign Node is a self-hosted proxy that lets you route requests to any API—your APIs—while keeping full control over keys, headers, and behavior. No hardcoded brands. No hidden analytics. Just a clear container for your tools.

Built for:

🔐 Personal sovereignty

🧠 Developer remixability

💡 Non-coders who want to deploy without learning Git


It comes ready to deploy on platforms like Render with zero local setup. Plug in your keys, map your endpoints, and go.

✨ Core Principles

Brandless by default: You decide what services to invoke

Ritual logic: Every route is intentional, named by you

Consent-focused: API keys are never committed, always optional

Form-driven config: Non-coders can add keys via /add-key web interface


🚀 Quickstart

1. Fork this repo or click “Use this template”


2. Deploy it on Render (free or $7/month starter)


3. Add your API keys at /add-key


4. Send requests to /api/custom/your-endpoint



That’s it. You’ve got a fully functional, name-agnostic backend.
